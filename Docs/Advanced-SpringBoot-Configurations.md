# Advanced Spring Boot Configurations

## Caching

The caching alternative can be a better option in certain scenarios. Here are some pros and cons to consider:

Pros:

Improved performance: Caching can significantly improve the performance of your application by reducing the number of requests to the underlying configuration source.
Reduced latency: By storing the configuration properties in a cache, you can reduce the latency associated with accessing the properties.
Increased scalability: Caching can help your application scale more efficiently by reducing the load on the underlying configuration source.

Cons:

Added complexity: Implementing a caching mechanism can add complexity to your application.
Cache invalidation: You need to ensure that the cache is properly invalidated when the underlying configuration properties change.
Cache size: You need to manage the size of the cache to prevent it from growing too large.
When to use caching:

High-traffic applications: If your application experiences high traffic, caching can help improve performance and reduce latency.
Large configuration datasets: If you have a large dataset of configuration properties, caching can help improve performance by reducing the number of requests to the underlying configuration source.
Real-time applications: If your application requires real-time access to configuration properties, caching can help ensure that the properties are available quickly.
How to implement caching:

Use a caching library: You can use a caching library such as Ehcache, Guava Cache, or Redis to implement caching in your application.
Implement a cache layer: You can implement a cache layer between your application and the underlying configuration source to store the configuration properties.
Use a caching annotation: You can use a caching annotation such as @Cacheable to mark methods that should be cached.
