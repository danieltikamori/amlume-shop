Yes, using multiple Docker Compose files is highly recommended and a standard best practice, especially given the context of needing different configurations for local development versus production, and your plan to eventually separate services. The most common and effective pattern is to use:

1.  **`docker-compose.yml` (Base Configuration):**
    * Defines the core services that exist in all environments (local, staging, prod).
    * Specifies the basic service structure, image names (often without tags, or with base tags), common environment variables (placeholders if values differ), network definitions.
    * **Example Content:** Service definitions for `shop-app`, `auth-server` (even if it runs within the `shop-app` container locally, you might define the service structure here), placeholders for `mysql-auth` and `mysql-shop`, `vault`.

2.  **`docker-compose.override.yml` (Local Development Overrides):**
    * This file is automatically picked up by `docker-compose up` if it exists alongside `docker-compose.yml`.
    * **Purpose:** Overrides or adds configurations specifically for local development.
    * **Example Content:**
        * Mount local source code volumes (`volumes: - ./shop-app:/app`).
        * Expose ports directly to the host (`ports: - "8080:8080"`).
        * Use `build:` directives instead of pre-built images.
        * Add development-only services like `vault-seeder`.
        * Set environment variables specific to local dev (e.g., `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev`, activating your `LocalSecurityConfig`).
        * Define the MySQL service(s) needed for local dev (maybe just one initially if auth is in-memory, or two if you want to mirror prod structure early).
        * Use less restrictive settings (e.g., debug modes).

3.  **`docker-compose.prod.yml` (Production Configuration):**
    * **Purpose:** Overrides or adds configurations specifically for production. You explicitly include this file when running commands (`docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up`).
    * **Example Content:**
        * Specify exact production image tags (`image: mycompany/shop-app:1.2.3`).
        * Do NOT mount source code volumes.
        * Define two separate MySQL services (`mysql-auth`, `mysql-shop`) with persistent volumes configured for production.
        * Configure production environment variables (fetched securely, e.g., from Vault directly by the app or injected via orchestration).
        * Set resource limits (`deploy: resources: limits: ...`).
        * Define restart policies (`restart: always`).
        * Configure production logging drivers.
        * Do NOT include development services like `vault-seeder`.
        * Might not expose ports directly (rely on an ingress controller or load balancer).

**Why use this approach?**

* **Clarity:** Keeps environment-specific configurations separate and easy to understand.
* **Maintainability:** Reduces the chance of accidentally deploying development settings (like mounted volumes or debug flags) to production.
* **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** The base `docker-compose.yml` defines the common structure, avoiding duplication.
* **Flexibility:** Easily add other environment files (e.g., `docker-compose.staging.yml`) if needed.
* **Standard Practice:** This is the idiomatic way to handle environment differences with Docker Compose.

**How to run:**

* **Local Development:** Simply run `docker-compose up` (automatically uses `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.override.yml`).
* **Production:** Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d` (explicitly specifies the base and production override files).

**In your specific case:** This approach perfectly handles:

* Running the auth server embedded locally (`override.yml`) vs. potentially separate (defined in `prod.yml` and `base.yml`).
* Using in-memory auth locally (`override.yml`) vs. persistent JDBC auth in production (`prod.yml`).
* Using one or two MySQL instances locally (`override.yml`) vs. definitely two separate instances in production (`prod.yml`).
* Including `vault-seeder` locally (`override.yml`) vs. excluding it in production (`prod.yml`).

Therefore, yes, adopt the multi-file Compose setup (base + override + prod) now. It will make managing your configurations much cleaner as you evolve the application.
