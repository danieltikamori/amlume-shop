# Concurrency Implementation Details

The following concurrency improvements have been made to the CategoryService:

1. **ExecutorService Configuration**
   - Added `ConcurrencyConfig` to create a thread pool sized to the number of available processors
   - Thread pool is managed as a Spring Bean for proper lifecycle management

2. **Parallel Processing**
   - `getAllCategories()` uses parallel streams for concurrent processing of category mappings
   - Improves performance when dealing with large numbers of categories

3. **Asynchronous Operations**
   - All CRUD operations now use `CompletableFuture` for asynchronous processing
   - Operations are executed in the managed thread pool
   - Proper exception handling is maintained through CompletableFuture's error handling

4. **Method-specific Implementation Details**:
   - `getAllCategories`: Uses parallel streams for concurrent DTO mapping
   - `createCategory`: Async validation and creation with proper error handling
   - `deleteCategory`: Async deletion with immediate feedback
   - `updateCategory`: Async update with validation and persistence

5. **Benefits**:
   - Improved throughput for bulk operations
   - Better resource utilization
   - Non-blocking operations where possible
   - Maintained thread safety with proper synchronization
